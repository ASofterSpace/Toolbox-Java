# Toolbox-Java

**Class:** Toolbox

**Language:** Java

**Platform:** Any

A toolbox for java source code snippets that (hopefully) help getting stuff done.

## Setup

To use the com.asofterspace.toolbox package in some other project when using eclipse, right-click on the other project, select Build Path > Configure Build Paths, and in the opening window select Projects, and add this project (Toolbox) there...
Immediately, it should start to work! =)

## Test

To build the classes contained in the toolbox and run the self-tests, execute under Windows:

```
build.bat
```

Or under Linux:

```
build.sh
```
