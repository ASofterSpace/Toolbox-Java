# Toolbox-Java
A toolbox for java source code snippets that help getting stuff done

To use the com.asofterspace.toolbox package in some other project when using eclipse, right-click on the other project, select Build Path > Configure Build Paths, and in the opening window select Projects, and add this project (Toolbox) there...
Immediately, it should start to work! =)
